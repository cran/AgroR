Description: Performs the analysis of completely randomized experimental designs (CRD), randomized blocks (RBD) and Latin square (LSD), experiments in double and triple factorial scheme (in DIC and DBC), experiments in subdivided plot scheme (in DIC and DBC), subdivided and joint analysis of experiments in DIC and DBC, linear regression analysis, test for two samples. The package performs analysis of variance, ANOVA assumptions and multiple comparison test of means or regression, according to Pimentel-Gomes (2009, ISBN: 978-85-7269-566-4), nonparametric test (Conover, 1999, ISBN: 0471160687), test for two samples, joint analysis of experiments according to Ferreira (2018, ISBN: 978-85-7269-566-4), Anova of aligned ranks (Wobbrock, JO, Findlater, L., Gergle, D., & Higgins , JJ (2011), <doi: 10.1145/1978942.1978963> It can also be used to obtain descriptive measures and graphics, in addition to correlations and creative graphics used in agricultural sciences (Agronomy, Zootechnics, Food Science and related areas).
