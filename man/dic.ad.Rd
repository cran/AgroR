}
\value{
The table of analysis of variance, the test of normality of errors (Shapiro-Wilk ("sw"), Lilliefors ("li"), Anderson-Darling ("ad"), Cramer-von Mises ("cvm"), Pearson ("pearson") and Shapiro-Francia ("sf")), the test of homogeneity of variances (Bartlett ("bt") or Levene ("levene")), the test of independence of Durbin-Watson errors, adjustment of regression models up to grade 3 polynomial. The function also returns a standardized residual plot.
}
\description{
Statistical analysis of experiments conducted in a completely randomized with an additional treatment and balanced design with a factor considering the fixed model.
}
\note{
In some experiments, the researcher may study a quantitative factor, such as fertilizer doses, and present a control, such as a reference fertilizer, treated as a qualitative control. In these cases, there is a difference between considering only the residue in the unfolding of the polynomial, removing or not the qualitative treatment, or since a treatment is excluded from the analysis. In this approach, the residue used is also considering the qualitative treatment, a method similar to the factorial scheme with additional control.
